Aztec Temple Run is a board like game where you need to win against your friend.
This game was made for Android devices in Unity Game Engine.
As a programmer in this project I have set the movements of the figurines in the game in a way that I have put empty game objects as waypoints and number you got on the dice would add to waypoint number.

Medieval Clicker is a clicker game that was made for PC in Unity Game Engine. The game was developed over the period of 5 days.
This game was made completely by me and most of the gameplay elements I have incorporated in the game are random events using Coroutine, using over 1000 lines of code.
Code can be accesed <a href="https://github.com/Shadowh86/Medieval-Clicker"> on my github</a>

 This Endless runner game was made for a game jam that was themed "Save yourself not the world", in Unity course in Novska, Croatia, over the period of 14 days.
 In this game you play as a woman who is running from the end of the world, with a meter counter that tells you how far you have already run to survive.
 For this game I was a Team Leader and Level Designer.
 As team leader I have organized 2 people to program movement of the main character as well as end game event.
 Also, as Level Designer I have put several prefabs that randomly generate in front of the main character, using empty game objects. 
 First game object was placed in front of the prefab and second one in the end of the prefab, resulting in the effect that where the last empty game object ends, first empty game object instanciates.<br>

 This game was made as a part of game jam with the theme "Glitch" in Unity Engine in Novska, Croatia over the period of 3 days.
 In this project I was Team Leader and my job was to coordinate programmer and level designer to make this puzzle game containing multiple glitches and to use glitches as parts of different levels.<br>

https://manpower.hr/news/new-post-1623069771">Manpower</a> and <a href="https://game-chuck.com/">Gamechuck</a>. The task of this game jam was to finish the project in 48 hours since that was how long the game jam lasted. Our project was an education simulator for obtaning a forklift operator certificate. For this project we worked on programming the input system for steering wheel logitech G29 and VR glasses in Unity Game engine.
In this project I have worked together with a colleague Andrej Lukic, where we won first place for our simulator, as well as an additional prize for use of inovative technologies that were avaliable to us.
