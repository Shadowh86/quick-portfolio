Aztec Temple Run is board like game where you need to win against your friend.
This game was made for Android devices in Unity Game Engine.
In that project I have worked as programmer that had job to set movements of figurines and the way I have done it is I have put empty game objects as waypoints and number you got in dice it would add to waypoint number.

Medieval Clicker is clicker game that was made for PC in Unity Game Engine.
This game was made completely by me and most stuff I have done there is random events.
There are over 1000 lines of code in that game that generate random events that where done with Corutines and coin flip if that event would happen.
